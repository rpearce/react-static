# statik-js (work in progress)
Node.js + markdown static markup generator

## Current Usage
To compile super messy HTML files based off of markdown files located within `src/posts`:
```bash
$ npm run build
```

## Future
The goal of this project is to have a static site generator that uses
React.js behind the scenes to build static markup yet also allow for
single-page application functionality, given JavaScript is enabled by
the end-user.
